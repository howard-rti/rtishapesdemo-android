# RTI Shapes Demo For Android

Installation and Setup
-----------------------
These instructions are for a Windows development host.

1. You need to have Eclipse and the Android ADT plugin installed. The Android ADT plugin depends on the Android SDK. You can:

    1. Install the Eclipse ADT Bundle, which has Eclipse with ADT in a single installer.
     
      Use this if you don't have Eclipse on your computer yet. Look for the Download the [SDK ADT Bundle for Windows link](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and follow [these instructions](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html).
    
    2. Install the ADT plugin and Android SDK separately.
    
      Use this if you already have an Eclipse installation that you want to use. Look for the ["Use an existing IDE" link](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and follow [these instructions](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html).


2. Use the Android SDK Manager to install the Android platforms for which you want to build (e.g., Android 4.1.2, Android 4.2.2, Android 4.3, etc.).  Make use that you run the Android SDK Manager with Adminstrator Priviledges if on Windows 7.

3. Install RTI Connext DDS development platform (and Connext DDS target libraries for Android)

  NOTE: RTI offers the Android target platform only for RTI Connext 5.1.0 and higher.

  You'll need to get this from your local RTI representative. Contact info@rti.com to find out who this is.
  
4. Generate the type support code for Java

   (assuming that you have RTI Connext DDS properly installed and with the $(NDDSHOME) environment variable set to the installation directory of connext.5.x/ndds.5.x.x
   
    1. Open a shell/command prompt to the ShapesDemo project directory
    2. cd to "src" 
        you should see the file "ShapesType.idl" in the current working directory
    3. run the following command
     
       $(NDDSHOME)/scripts/rtiddsgen -replace -language Java -package com.rti.android.shapesdemo.idl ShapeType.idl
       
       you may need to also use "-ppdisable" if you're developing on a Windows host

5. Open ShapesDemo project in Eclipse
   
    1. Start Eclipse
    2. Use File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace
    3. Select the directory where you have installed the ShapesDemo project

6. Add nddsjava.jar and supporting shared libraries to project

    1. Open Properties for the ShapesDemo project
    2. Select "Java Build Path", and in the "Libraries" tab, use "Add External JAR" to add "nddsjava.jar" from 
       $(NDDSHOME)/class/
    3. In the "Java Build Path" -> "Order and Export" tab, check to select "nddsjava.jar".
    4. In the same tab, select "nddsjava.jar" and use the buttons on the side and move it to the top.
    5. Copy "libnddsjava.so", "libnddsc.so", and "libnddscore.so" from $(NDDSHOME)/lib/armv7aAndroid2.3gcc4.8jdk
       into the project directory libs/armeabi-v7a

7. To generate the APK, with the ShapesDemo project selected in the Project Explorer, you will need to select "Run" from the "Run" menu.  

   You may need to use "Run As"  -->  "Android Application"
   
   (at this time, your Android device should already be attached via USB in debug mode, or you can have Eclipse start an emulator.
   
   Please consult the Android eclipse SDK documentation for further information.
   

   NOTE:  On Windows, you may need to install or update your USB driver for your specific device.
          Please see: http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html

## Getting Started
------------------

1. Installing `ShapesDemo.apk` on a real Android Device
    1. Attach your Device via USB
    
    2. Enable your Device to install apps from unknown sources. 
      On Device, use Settings -> Security -> Unknown Sources, check the checkbox
        
    3. Optional, enable your Device to allow debugging over USB
      On Device, use Settings -> Developer options -> USB debugging, check the checkbox
      NOTE: You may need to enable the Developer options menu option on some devices.
      e.g., on Nexus 7, use Settings -> About tablet -> Build number, select Build number 10 times (or so)
        
    4. Installing the .apk
    
        1. Using Eclipse
          
          Use Run -> Run or Debug. This will automatically build the project (so project must successfully build).
     
          The dialog, Android Device Chooser, should popup and show your device. 
          If your device is not shown as "online", you probably need to go to the Device itself 
          which has popped up a dialog asking you for permission to allow your computer to connect 
          via USB for debugging.  Confirm (you may want to select the checkbox so that you never 
          have to confirm again for your computer).
          Select your device.
          The `ShapesDemo.apk` will automatically be installed and started.

        2. Using the ShapesDemo.apk directly
        
          If you have built the ShapesDemo via Eclipse or you want use the .apk that came prebuilt with 
          the installation located in `bin/ShapesDemo.apk`. You install the `ShapesDemo.apk` by either
          * Copying  `ShapesDemo.apk` to your Device's filesystem mounted via USB.
           Use a file manager app (which you'll need to install from Google Play, many free ones available)
           to select and install the .apk on your Device.
           Select the installed ShapesDemo icon to run.
          * or from a command line, running: 
        
                  adb install ShapesDemo.apk
        
            See http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html
 
2. Using a Device Emulator
 
    1. Create a Virtual Device via Eclipse
    Use Window -> Android Virtual Device Manager -> New
    
    2. In Eclipse, use Run -> Run or Debug
    This will automatically build the project (so project must successfully build).
    You may get dialog, Android Device Chooser, if you have a real Device connected via USB.
    Select your virtual device, or use Launch a new Android Virtual Device.
    The ShapesDemo.apk will automatically be installed and started.

## Running

1. ShapesDemo is configured to work using Android's WiFi network interface, 
so your device should be connected to a WiFi network.
    
    
2. Run ShapesDemo.exe on your computer. Your computer should be on the same 
WiFi network (on the same subnet).
   
   
3. By default, multicast discovery is used.

    1. Windows 7 users should make sure that their WiFi's network location is set to either
    Home, Work, or Domain.  If the network location is set to Public, the Windows 7 firewall may
    prevent full discovery...so in that case, either change the network location or disable the
    firewall.
    
    2. If the computer and Android device on are different subnets or multicast is not
    supported on the WiFi network, then you should use `NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS` environment
    variable to set the IP addresses of the computer and/or device as the initial peers for
    discovery.
    The Android device's IP address on WiFi can be found using Settings -> WiFi -> `< whatever WiFi network is connected >`.
    You can set the computer's IP address in the Peer List for the ShapesDemo application on the
    Android device using the "..." -> Settings -> DDS Peer List preferences menu option.


4. In ShapesDemo.exe (on your computer), you MUST change the Liveliness Kind of your 
shape publishers (datawriters) to `MANUAL_BY_TOPIC` for the Android subscriber to receive the data.


5. Notes:
ShapesDemo on Android is configured by default to publish/subscribe using `BEST_EFFORT_RELIABILITY` 
and `MANUAL_BY_TOPIC` Liveliness kind.


6. See Troubleshooting section below if you can't get the two ShapesDemos to exchange data.
    
    
File Description
-----------------
### Java ###
 
* `src/com/rti/android/shapesdemo/ShapesDemo.java` - The main Activity for ShapesDemo. Handles all of the button actions and has a periodic event to redraw the canvas.
 
* `src/com/rti/android/shapesdemo/DrawView.java` - Class that manages shapes that have been published and subscribed to as well as the canvas on which the shapes are drawn.
 
* `src/com/rti/android/shapesdemo/ShapesObject.java` - Class that implements the behavior of an shape.

* `src/com/rti/android/shapesdemo/ShapesDDS.java` - Class that manages how RTI Connext DDS is used for the ShapesDemo.
 
* `src/com/rti/android/shapesdemo/ShapesSetting.java` - Android Activity used to create "Settings" option.

* `src/com/rti/android/shapesdemo/util/Vector2d.java` - A mimimalistic implementation of a 2-D vector class with some helpful functions.
 
* `src/com/rti/android/shapesdemo/util/EditTextPreferenceWithValue.java` - Useful class so that when a preference (setting/option) is changed by the user, the new value is automatically reflected in the preferences menu.
 
 
### Android Application Files ###

* `AndroidManifest.xml` - Main definition file for ShapesDemo app including which Activity to start on startup

* `res/layout/activity_shapes_demo.xml` - main layout of the graphics elements of the ShapesDemo application

* `res/layout/preferences_with_value.xml` - utility used to define a layout where the current value of a preference are displayed on the same line as the preference.

* `res/menu/menu.xml` - defines the layout of the Android options menu

* `res/xml/settings.xml` - defines the preferences that can be set by the Settings option submen


## Troubleshooting
-------------------
  
1. ShapesDemo can't publish or subscribe to host?

    1. Make sure that the Android device and your host are on the same WiFi subnet.  If not, 
    you'll have to configure the `NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS` on your host or DDS Peer List in the settings
    menu of ShapesDemo to the actual IP addresses.
    
    2. On Windows 7 (and Linux) check your firewall, you may need to turn it off.
    
    3. Get data to Android but not from Android, probably because your host computer has too
    many active network interfaces (NIFs).  Disable all but your WiFi NIF and rerun RTI Shapes Demo.exe.
